what are Minimal Apis?
 -Minnimal Apis allows Api endpoints to be added to the application's configuration file 
 -No neet to go down the MVC route which adds a lot of boilerplate code.
 -Minimal Apis support dependency injection.
 -Need to make sure we don't add too many Minimal Api endpoints.

Differences between minimal APIs and APIs with controllers
No support for filters: For example, no support for IAsyncAuthorizationFilter, IAsyncActionFilter, IAsyncExceptionFilter, IAsyncResultFilter, and IAsyncResourceFilter.
No support for model binding, i.e. IModelBinderProvider, IModelBinder. Support can be added with a custom binding shim.
No support for binding from forms. This includes binding IFormFile. We plan to add support for IFormFile in the future.
No built-in support for validation, i.e. IModelValidator
No support for application parts or the application model. There's no way to apply or build your own conventions.
No built-in view rendering support. We recommend using Razor Pages for rendering views.
No support for JsonPatch
No support for OData
No support for ApiVersioning. See this issue for more details.
